Deep Learning model using Artificial Neural Network in Tensorflow / Keras

Building a model (ANN) in TensorFlow/Keras is the process of creating an Artificial Neural Network (ANN) using the TensorFlow and Keras libraries in Python. 
ANNs are a type of machine learning model inspired by the structure and functioning of the human brain. They are commonly used for tasks like classification, regression, and pattern recognition.
